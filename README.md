# Hand-Signal-recognition-using-Jetson-Nano-Developer-Kit
Hand gesture allows precise and instinctive ways to maneuver the complicated
machine. We can develop a method with the use of computer vision algorithm to develop a
spontaneous way of agent-less communication between a drone and its operator.In this project we propose
the use of hand gestures as a method to control drones. Computer vision-based methods
rely on the ability of a drone's camera to capture surrounding images and use pattern
recognition to translate images to meaningful and/or actionable information. They are:
image separation from the video streams of the front camera, creating a robust and reliable
image recognition based on segregated images, and finally conversion of classified
gestures into actionable drone movement, such as takeoff, landing, hovering and so forth.
